# <center> An Introduction to Agent-Based Life Cycle Assessment with Python </center>

This is an introduction to agent-based life cycle assessment (AB-LCA). This notebook will cover the basics of agent-based modeling (ABM) with Mesa, a Python library dedicated to facilitate the building of agent-based models. Then it will present a simple AB-LCA model on plastic recycling that leverages both Mesa and Brightway2, an open source Python framework for LCA.

At the end of this notebook, you will be able to:

* *Understand the Mesa's basic building blocks.*
* *Build a simple ABM.*
* *Link the ABM outputs to an LCA and vice versa.*

This introduction is written in an Jupyter notebook, an online scientific notebook which combines, text, data, images, and programming. It is built upon both Mesa and Brightway2 tutorials.

* [Mesa tutorial](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html).
* [Brightway2 tutorial](https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2/blob/master/notebooks/Getting%20Started%20with%20Brightway2.ipynb).

You should **download the notebook** in this repository and follow along!
